            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a child of Internet, I know a bit about a lot of stuff. Have a strong background in literature due to my academic choices :) Born in India thus know a lot about it.</p>
            <p><b>I can write stuff for you, Ask me, pay me and have it.</b></p>
            <p>I do academic writing, content writing for mass media, editorials, blogs, copy writing and what not! If it's just a combination of words I can do it.</p>
            <p><strong>I have designed this site from scratch.</strong>
                <br>Yeah this feels more like crap but still it's far better than those click and shoot sites.</p>
            <p><b>I don't like reading but you'll pay and I'll do it.</b>
                <br>I have done proof-reading, transcribing, literature review (it was sheer pain) and a lot of academic reading for research stuff.</p>
